# US_Transportation_Accident_Prediction

As I worked as a Data Analyst in one of my previous experiences at a Transportation firm, I thought of predicting certain metrics pertaining to accidents/crashes based on past large-scale data. 

I've used ML Supervised learning algorithms like RandomForest and XGBoost to forecast crash durations in the future, in order to provide an estimate for the emergency vehicles to make it to the crash location on time. 

Starting from Data-Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model building to Model Evaluation, this end-to-end ML project showcases my ability to leverage Data Science for Social Good.

Thanks!
